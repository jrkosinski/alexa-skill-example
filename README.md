Alexa Skill Example
===============

This example is adapted from a real project, with the names of project sections (as well as some other things) changed. Some parts of the project have been removed. WYSIWYG, but it demonstrates some good practices in Alexa development. 

Note also that it connections to AWS IoT in the back end, in order to facilitate the "call phone" function. The original project also used an Android companion app to help facilitate that feature (but that code is not included here).
